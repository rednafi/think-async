"""
Producer-consumer pattern using Python's asyncioâ€”
where both of the entities are long running.

Producer
--------
Here, the producer generates a sequeunce of numbers 0,1,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,4 indefinitely.
However, it only puts non-zero values into the queue.

Consumer
--------
The consumer only runs when a non-zero value appears on the queue and lets the
producer run again. This juggling between producer and consumer goes on indefinitely.
